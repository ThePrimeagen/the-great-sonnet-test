Based on the error message and the provided context, it appears that there is a syntax issue in the `challenge.js` file. Let's carefully review and correct the `challenge.js` file to ensure it conforms to the requirements specified in the test file.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Check for Syntax Errors**:
   Ensure that there are no syntax errors in the `challenge.js` file. The provided code snippet should be correct and should not produce any syntax errors.

2. **Ensure Correct Export**:
   Make sure that the `challenge` object is correctly exported using `export default challenge;`.

3. **File Encoding and Hidden Characters**:
   Ensure the file is saved with UTF-8 encoding and does not contain any hidden characters that might cause syntax issues.

4. **Dependencies and Environment**:
   Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed and the environment is correctly configured for running JavaScript and Vitest.

### Corrected `challenge.js` File

Here is the corrected version of the `challenge.js` file, which should pass the test:

```javascript
// challenge.js
const challenge = {
    run() {
        return 42;
    }
};

export default challenge;
```

### Running the Tests

After ensuring the `challenge.js` file is correct, run the tests using the following command:

```sh
vitest run
```

### Full Solution

Let's put everything together to ensure it works correctly.

#### `challenge.js`

```javascript
// challenge.js
const challenge = {
    run() {
        return 42;
    }
};

export default challenge;
```

#### `challenge.test.js`

```javascript
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import challenge from "./challenge.js";

test("runs the challenge run function 100 times", () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        const out = challenge.run();
        expect(out).toEqual(42);
    }
});
```

### Explanation

1. **`challenge.js`**:
   - Defines an object `challenge` with a method `run` that returns the number 42.
   - Exports the `challenge` object as the default export.

2. **`challenge.test.js`**:
   - Imports the necessary functions from `vitest`.
   - Imports the `challenge` object from `challenge.js`.
   - Defines a test that runs the `challenge.run` function 100 times and checks that the output is always 42.

By following these steps and ensuring the `challenge.js` file is correctly implemented, the tests should pass successfully.
